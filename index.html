		<br>[Geforce] > idi0t
		<br>[Vauff] *id0t
		<br>[Geforce] o true
		<br>[Geforce] tf is an id0t
		<br>[Vauff] let's break it down
		<br>[Vauff] id0t is clearly meant to represent idot
		<br>[Vauff] so you're an idot
		<br>[Vauff] but what's an idot?
		<br>[Vauff] well a dot is a thing
		<br>[Vauff] and apple adds i in front of all their product names
		<br>[Vauff] so in conclusion you're an apple themed dot named iDot
